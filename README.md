# APK Puller
A very very simple and minimalistic tool to pull installed app's APK files to your Downloads folder

## Info
Search for your app's package name by giving a part of its name, copy the path by tapping on the results box, and paste it in second text box.
Then you can press Pull button and it pulls the APK file to `PATH/Downloads/exported_apk.apk` (yes, it will overwrite each time you use it)
